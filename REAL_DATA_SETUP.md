## üöÄ How to Enable Real Data

1. **Copy environment file:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. **Add your API keys to `.env.local`:**
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_key_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_RESTAURANT_PLACE_ID=your_place_id_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_YELP_API_KEY=your_yelp_key_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_YELP_BUSINESS_ID=your_business_id_here
   ```

3. **Restart your development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## üìä Data Priority Order

1. **POS System** (most accurate - real kitchen data)
2. **Google Places** (reliable business hours)
3. **Yelp** (backup business status)
4. **Time-based calculation** (fallback when no APIs available)

## üîÑ Real-time Updates

- **With APIs:** Updates every 2 minutes
- **Fallback mode:** Updates every 5 minutes
- **Automatic failover** if APIs are unavailable

## üéØ Benefits of Real Data

- **Accurate open/closed status** from business systems
- **Real busy levels** based on actual orders
- **Reliable hours** that update automatically
- **Customer trust** with "LIVE" data indicators
- **Better user experience** with accurate information

## üõ†Ô∏è Current Status

The system will automatically detect which data sources are available and use them in priority order. If no real data sources are configured, it falls back to intelligent time-based calculations.

Check the browser console for logs showing which data source is being used.
